In the context of global warming, the filtration, separation and capture of CO$_2$ from the atmosphere and from gas sources is becoming crucial as an attempt to steam the rise in the temperature of the earth's surface. However, since CO$_2$ is present in the atmosphere in concentrations of the order of 0.04 \%, the process of separating CO$_2$ from other gases is challenging and complex.
